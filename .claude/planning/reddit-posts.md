**Title**: I built an MCP server that makes Claude way more consistent

**Body**:

```
Hey r/ClaudeAI!

I kept running into the same problem - I'd ask Claude to "build login" and it would skip password reset, forget social auth, and ignore half my requirements. Every time I asked, I got different code.

So I built Clouvel, an MCP server that adds a PRD gate to Claude.

How it works:
- You ask Claude to code something
- Clouvel checks if a PRD (spec) exists
- No spec? Blocked. Write the spec first.
- Spec exists? Go ahead.

Demo: https://whitening-sinabro.github.io/clouvel/assets/demo.gif

The idea is simple - same spec, same output. Every time.

Free tier has PRD gate, templates, progress tracking. Pro ($9.99/mo) adds 8 AI manager personas that review your code before you ship.

I'm doing a launch offer - first 50 users get 70% off Pro ($2.99/mo). Code is LAUNCH70.

Pro: https://buy.polar.sh/polar_cl_YVVTx0UOobHJOTG9FinmAJyg7ZrfClSHdNYg51F5mzf

Anyone else frustrated with inconsistent AI output? How do you handle it?

**Title**: I built a "spec gate" for AI coding - 70% off this week

**Body**:

```
Hey everyone!

As a solo dev, I use AI coding assistants constantly. But I noticed a pattern - AI would "interpret" my vague requests and build something 80% right. Then I'd spend hours debugging the 20%.

The pattern:
- "Build login" → skips password reset
- "Add dashboard" → different layout every time
- "Create API" → inconsistent error handling

So I built Clouvel, an MCP server that blocks AI from coding until you write a spec.

It sounds annoying, but it actually saves time. Writing a 10-minute spec means AI knows exactly what to build, and you get consistent output every time.

Demo: https://whitening-sinabro.github.io/clouvel/assets/demo.gif

Quick start:
pip install clouvel
clouvel install

The core is free and open source.

I also have a Pro version ($9.99/mo) with "manager" personas that review your code - like having a virtual PM and CTO.

Doing a launch deal this week - first 50 users get 70% off ($2.99/mo). Use code LAUNCH70.

GitHub: https://github.com/Whitening-Sinabro/clouvel
Pro: https://buy.polar.sh/polar_cl_YVVTx0UOobHJOTG9FinmAJyg7ZrfClSHdNYg51F5mzf

Anyone else building tools to make AI coding more predictable?

**Title**: Changing my target market - giving first 50 users 70% off

**Body**:

```
Hey indie hackers!

Quick story about a pivot.

I built Clouvel, a PRD-first gate for AI coding. Initially targeted a small local market, but realized the Claude Code / MCP ecosystem is global and English-first.

Instead of fighting an uphill battle, I pivoted to target solo devs globally. Spent a week converting everything - docs, error messages, landing page.

What Clouvel does:

It blocks AI from coding until you write a spec. Sounds simple, but it solves the "AI lottery" problem where you get different code every time you ask.

Before: "Build login" → AI guesses, different result each time
After: "Build login" → AI reads your PRD, builds exactly what you specified

Demo: https://whitening-sinabro.github.io/clouvel/assets/demo.gif

Business model:
- Free: Core PRD gate (open source)
- Pro: 8 AI manager personas review your code

To celebrate the pivot, first 50 users get 70% off Pro.

Regular: $9.99/mo
Early bird: $2.99/mo (locked in)

Use code LAUNCH70: https://buy.polar.sh/polar_cl_YVVTx0UOobHJOTG9FinmAJyg7ZrfClSHdNYg51F5mzf

Lessons learned:
1. Go where your users are, not where you want them to be
2. English-first for dev tools
3. MCP ecosystem is small but growing fast

Does "PRD-first AI coding" resonate with you?
