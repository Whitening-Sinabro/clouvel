    "q2": "Can I use my own PRD template?",
    "a2": "Yes. Use your existing template as-is. Clouvel just gates on document \"existence\", not specific format.",
    "q3": "Does it work offline/locally?",
    "a3": "License activation needs internet once. After that, works fully offline.",
    "q4": "How does it fit my existing workflow?",
    "a4": "It's an MCP server - just add config to Claude Code/Desktop. Doesn't touch your code or project structure.",
    "q5": "Why not just use a prompt or CLAUDE.md?",
    "a5": "A prompt is a \"request\". A gate is a \"rule\". Requests can be ignored. Gates either pass or block. Rules create consistency."
