  "faq": {
    "title": "FAQ",
    "q1": "What exactly does Clouvel do?",
    "a1": "Clouvel is an MCP server that runs alongside Claude Code. It records every error with root cause analysis, warns you before repeating past mistakes, and blocks coding until you have a spec document.",
    "q2": "Why not just use CLAUDE.md?",
    "a2": "CLAUDE.md is static rules you write by hand. Clouvel learns automatically from your actual errors and decisions.",
    "q3": "Does it work offline?",
    "a3": "Yes. Pro license activation needs internet once. After that, everything works fully offline.",
    "q4": "Does it touch my code or project files?",
    "a4": "No. Clouvel is an MCP server - it provides tools to Claude Code but never modifies your source code.",
    "q5": "Is Free actually usable?",
    "a5": "Yes. 10 real tools that work. Pro adds full history, pattern learning, cross-project memory, and the complete manager review."
