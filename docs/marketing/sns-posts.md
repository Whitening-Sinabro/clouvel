## Launch Announcement (Twitter/X)

### Version A - Problem-focused
```
Shipped: Clouvel - "No spec, no code"

Tired of AI writing "almost right" code?

The problem:
AI compresses your requirements.
"Build login" → skips password reset, OAuth, rate limiting.

The fix:
PRD-First gate. No docs? No coding.

Free & open source.

#buildinpublic #indiehackers
```

### Version B - Solution-focused
```
Just launched Clouvel

What it does:
Blocks AI coding until you write specs.

Why:
- AI skips requirements silently
- "Almost right" code = debugging hell
- Same prompt, different results

Now:
No PRD? BLOCKED.
Complete PRD? PASS.

Try it: pip install clouvel

#opensource #claudecode
```

### Version C - Story-focused
```
I spent 3 days debugging AI-generated code.

The bug? AI "forgot" password reset.
I said "build login" - it skipped half the features.

So I built Clouvel.

It's a gate:
No spec → No code

Now AI reads my PRD before coding.
Same input = same output.

## Threads Posts

### Thread 1 - The Problem
```
Post 1:
AI coding has a dirty secret:

It compresses your requirements.

You say "build login"
AI hears "build basic auth, skip everything else"

Let me explain why this happens... 🧵

Post 2:
LLMs have context limits.
When context fills up, they summarize.
Summarizing = losing details.

Your 10-point spec becomes 3 points.
Password reset? Gone.
Rate limiting? Gone.
OAuth? Gone.

Post 3:
The result?

"Almost right" code.

It works... mostly.
Then you spend 2-3 days debugging.
Finding the missing pieces.

Post 4:
My solution: Clouvel

A simple gate:
- No PRD? Can't code.
- Incomplete PRD? Warning.
- Complete PRD? Go ahead.

It's free. It's open source.
