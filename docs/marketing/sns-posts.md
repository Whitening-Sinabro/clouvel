## Twitter/X — Launch Day

### Post A: Problem → Solution
```
Claude Code is incredibly fast.

But it has zero memory.

It breaks something → you fix it → next session it breaks the same thing.

I built Clouvel to fix this:
- Remembers every error pattern
- Warns before repeats
- Ships with proof

Free & open source. 5K+ monthly installs.

pip install clouvel

Launched on Product Hunt today 👇

### Post B: Numbers-focused
```
Launching Clouvel on @ProductHunt today 🚀

What it does:
→ Gives Claude Code a persistent memory
→ 20 MCP tools (10 free)
→ Same bug never ships twice

Numbers:
→ 5,100+ monthly installs
→ $0 marketing spend
→ Solo developer

Try it: pip install clouvel

#buildinpublic #devtools
```

### Post C: Technical hook
```
Claude Code forgets everything between sessions.

Your errors. Your decisions. Your context. All gone.

Clouvel remembers:
🔴 Error patterns → auto-catch regression
🟡 Decisions → persist in knowledge base
🟢 Ship evidence → lint/test/build in one report

It's an MCP server. Install: pip install clouvel

Open source. Launched on PH today:

## Twitter/X — Teaser (D-3)

### Teaser A
```
Something I've been building for 3 months is launching next week.

It fixes the biggest problem with AI coding tools:
They have no memory.

More soon. 👀

#buildinpublic
```

### Teaser B
```
Quick question for Claude Code users:

How often does Claude break something you already fixed in a previous session?

For me it was multiple times per week.

I built something to fix it. Launching on @ProductHunt [date].

#claudecode #devtools
```

## Threads — Launch Day Thread

```
Post 1:
I launched Clouvel on Product Hunt today.

It fixes the biggest problem with AI coding:
AI has no memory.

Here's what I mean... 🧵

Post 2:
Session 1: "Build auth system"
→ Claude writes perfect code

Session 2: "Refactor the API"
→ Auth system breaks. The same way as last time.

Session 3: "Add tests"
→ Breaks it again.

Every session starts from zero.

Post 3:
Clouvel gives Claude Code a persistent brain:

🔴 Regression Memory
Records every error pattern. Same bug tries to recur? Caught automatically.

🟡 8 AI Managers
CTO, QA, Security officer review your plan before coding starts.

🟢 Ship with Proof
One command: lint → test → build → evidence file.

Post 4:
Numbers so far:
- 5,100+ monthly installs
- 20 tools (10 completely free)
- 100% local — no data leaves your machine
- Open source

Install: pip install clouvel
Product Hunt: [PH_LINK]

Would love your support! 🙏
